    <section style="color:blueviolet;">
    <p>When I arrived at AkiraChix, it was night, and I was starving due to fasting on Friday. <span style="border:2px solid;">I couldn't eat the chicken on the plane.</span>
        <span style="border:2px solid;">However, I was warmly welcomed by the alumni and Nancy, which made me feel happy to be in this amazing tech and women-empowering environment.</span>  When I shared my hunger challenge with Nancy, she kindly offered me rice, and I ate, took a shower, and went to sleep.</p>

    <p>The next morning, I was excited to explore the area and enjoyed spending time with my friends. A few days after my arrival, we started classes. I was surprised to learn that classes began at 7 AM, and waking up early was a bit shocking at first. However, after two days, I adapted to the schedule and managed my time better, waking up earlier with ease.</p>

    <p>Overall, I felt happy about my journey here at <b>AkiraChix</b>. Now, I am in my second week, and I am looking forward to what is ahead.</p>
